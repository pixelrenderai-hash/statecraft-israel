# Changelog

All notable changes to Statecraft: Israel. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Every pull request that changes the game (`sim/`, `content/`, `unity/`)
adds a line under **Unreleased**; CI's `Changelog` job checks this (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Opt-in local HUD and Cabinet style previews (Archive, Clear Strategy and Map Table), with wrapping minister rows,
  readable appointment refusal reasons and selected navigation states. Map Table (`?ui-preview=table`) adds paper
  panels with captions, a structured Cabinet roster and a view-only selected-office detail. The default interface is
  unchanged.
- Opt-in local 3D building prototypes (`?building-preview`) on settlement markers, transit camps and housing, with
  ambient ships, an aircraft, a truck, a fort and figures, from models kept outside the repository while their rights
  are reviewed; a `-shareable` build and the release packager refuse them.
- Browser-playable 1948–1951 (milestone M3): HUD, Cabinet with appointments, Budget, Events, Defence and "Why did this
  happen?" screens over the 3D hex map; sourced content to 31 December 1951; saves; a calibrated economy; the golden
  hash checked in WebGL and macOS players.
- The map (milestone M2): terrain from Copernicus elevation data, biomes from rainfall, 1948 settlements on hexes.
- Open-source release (public since 2026-10-10): licences (MIT code, CC BY-SA 4.0 content, CC BY 4.0 original docs
  and art, CC0 for AI-only images), asset provenance (`ASSETS.yaml`), contributor
  and content policies, CI for the sim, tools and repository policy.
- Unity-MCP 0.93.3 (`com.ivanmurzak.unity.mcp`, from OpenUPM) as the standard AI-agent bridge in the editor, local
  Custom mode with token auth only (held by `UnityMcpGuard`). It stays offline in batch mode, opens no window there, and is
  left out of player builds.
